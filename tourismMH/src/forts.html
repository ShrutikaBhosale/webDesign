          Raigad Fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire from 1674 to 1818.
          It is located on a hilltop in the Sahyadri Mountains and is considered
          to be one of the most important forts in Indian history. The fort is
          well-preserved and offers stunning views of the surrounding
          countryside. Raigad Fort*, also known as Rairi or Rairy Fort, is a
          magnificent hill fort situated in the Sahyadri mountain range,
          overlooking the town of Mahad in the Raigad district of Maharashtra,
          India. Standing tall at an elevation of 2,700 feet (820 meters) above
          its base and 4,449 feet (1,356 meters) above sea level, Raigad Fort
          offers breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding landscape. Its
          strategic location and formidable defenses made it one of the
          strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau.
